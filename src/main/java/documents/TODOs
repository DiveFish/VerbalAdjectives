- for the most frequent adjectives, get their most frequent prepositions

- get distributions:
-x fix error in frequency counter: adjectives are cut off at size()-1 or -2... looks ok...(?) check!
-x include linesplit on # and %aux etc. for lemmas to reconstruct lemmas with separable particles
-x also consider OBJP (obligatory PPs which so far may have been missed for verbs - OBJP not for adjectives)
-x distinguish VADJ as ADV-head from all other head roles: ADJ has deprel label ADV
-x handle multi-word prepositions: dependent of preposition also has PP deprel label
<- multiheadedness vs. multidependence
-x process conjunction expressions:
startsWith("KO") PoS-tag for conjunctions AND "," (PUNCT);
head of conjunction is ADJ
-- reattach topicalized PP in Vorfeld to main verb

- check whether PP overlap is working, returns no prepositions for e.g. "überzüchtet" although it has "mit" as
